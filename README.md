# Midi to LDP8806 Lights

- requires the ldp8806 arduino library to be installed

This code uses hairless serial monitor to send signals from a controller either physical or a loopback from a software controller and using this information reactively creates various animations on a string of lights.

This is just proof of concept, but once the midi data is in the arduino, you can control anything with it!
